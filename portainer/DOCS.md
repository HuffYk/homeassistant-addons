# Home Assistant Add-on: ioBroker
Universal container management platform

## How to use

Portainer is by default available at port `8000` and `9000`.

Portainer requires Home Assistant protection mode to be disabled, as it requires administrative access to the docker platform. As a result, care must be taken when using the portainer tool.
